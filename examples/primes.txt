We want to show that there are infinitely many primes. We will argue this by assuming the opposite and deriving a contradiction.

== Argument ==

We introduce a finite set $P$ of all primes, and its product $m$.

\vbeg
Introduce $P,m$.

Assume for all $n \in \N$, if \l{$n$ is prime} then $n \in P$.

Assume \l{$P$ is a finite set}, \l{$P$ is non-empty}, and $P \subset \N$.

Assume $m = P_0 \cdot \ldots \cdot P_{|P|-1}$.
\vend

The above notation for the product of a subset of $\R$ has equivalent alternatives.

\vbeg
Assert $m = \prod P$.

Assert $m = \prod_{x \in P} x$. 
\vend

We now demonstrate that the above assumptions allow us to derive a contradiction.

\vbeg
Assert $m \in \N$.

Assert for any $p \in \N$, 
:if \l{$p$ is a prime factor of $m+1$} then
::\l{$p$ is not a factor of $m$},
::\l{$p$ is prime},
::$p \in P$,
::\l{$p$ is a factor of $m$},
::\l{there is a contradiction}.
\vend
